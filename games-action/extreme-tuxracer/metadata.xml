		Extreme Tux Racer is a racing game featuring Tux, the Linux Penguin.
		Extreme Tux Racer continues in the tracks of Tux Racer and its forks.

		The packages offered here provide a 'vanilla' USE flag, which, when
		disabled, makes the music files from Tux Racer be installed for those
		who enjoy the original, nostalgic music sound tracks more.  Enabling
		the USE flag causes music files from Extreme Tux Racer, some of which
		differ from Tux Racer's music, to be installed instead.
