# https://gitea.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/sh-elf-gcc/src/commit/91d27868951a31d482c8e0ac74a67bcc2e3c5614/patches/gcc-11.1.0-libstdc++-v3-skip-dlopen.patch

# Building libstdc++-v3 for a bare-bones compiler is somewhat in a gray area
# since we don't have a full hosted system to target. From a version of GCC to
# the next this might break in minor ways.
#
# Here, the issue is the reliance on a dlopen() check which cannot be
# completed because we don't have link tests. The intent of the configure
# script is to skip it for cross-compilers, which is materialized by the check
# for --with-newlib (which is somewhat abused to mean "no libc").
#
# However, building with --with-newlib is not quite right since we have our
# own libc and fails due to it enabling small newlib-specific bits of code
# that don't compile with the fxlibc.
#
# Instead, we disable the test when --without-headers is specified, which is
# the case in our configuration. This extra condition is already part of the
# upstreamed source in GCC 12.1.0, so this is basically a backport. We also
# backport disabling the GLIBCXX_CROSSCONFIG which would block the build.
#
