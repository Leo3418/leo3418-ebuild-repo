		ebuild-commander is a tool designed for ebuild installation testing.
		Inspired by ebuildtester, ebuild-commander tests ebuilds in Docker
		container derived from Gentoo stage3 images too, but it allows for
		finer granularity of control over the tests. Multiple 'emerge'
		commands and any arbitrary commands like 'cp' and 'rm' can be run
		within the container in a test. Portage configuration for a test,
		including directories not limited to 'package.accept_keywords',
		'package.env', 'env' and 'package.use', can be fully customized.
		Alternative container engines that are not Docker but provide a
		command-line interface compatible with Docker, such as Podman, can
		be used with ebuild-commander, exploiting their advantages like
		ability to use containers with a non-root user account.
